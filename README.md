## Development Process

I started building this weather app by following these steps:

**Step 1:** Create and structure the necessary project files.  
**Step 2:** Set up resources and all required configurations.  
**Step 3:** Build the UX/UI for the required screens (I followed the flow: loading → error → success).  
**Step 4:** Explore the Weather API to understand its response format and create appropriate models.  
**Step 5:** Use BLoC to handle API calls and manage input/output data effectively.  
**Step 6:** After processing the data and logic, implement and display them in the corresponding UI components.  
**Step 7:** Test the app with potential edge cases to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected scenarios properly.
