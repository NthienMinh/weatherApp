# weatherApp
I started this weather app project with the following steps:

Step 1: Create and structure the necessary files for the project.
Step 2: Set up resources and configurations required for the project.
Step 3: Build the UX/UI for the necessary screens (I followed the order: loading => error => success).
Step 4: Check the Weather API to understand the structure of the returned data and create the appropriate models.
Step 5: Use Bloc to handle API calls and manage the necessary input/output data.
Step 6: Once the data and logic are processed, display them on the corresponding UI
Step 7: Test the app with potential edge cases to ensure it runs smoothly and handles unexpected scenarios properly.

Finally, Thank you to the technical team for taking the time to review this.
